## Abstract

*This survey examines the emerging synergy between artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and theoretical condensed matter physics. Focusing on quantum many-body systems, superconductivity, and neural network-based renormalization group (RG) methods, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of how AI/ML techniques are transforming the field. We review a broad spectrum of approaches—from supervised and unsupervised learning to generative models and variational neural network ansätze—that have been successfully employed to identify phases of matter, extract hidden order parameters, and accelerate traditional simulation techniques. In particular, we highlight breakthroughs such as the neural network quantum state method for efficiently representing entangled quantum systems and neural RG schemes that autonomously learn effective coarse-graining transformations. These advances not only enhance computational efficiency but also offer novel theoretical insights, bridging data-driven methods with established physical principles. The survey further discusses the application of ML in predicting superconducting properties and guiding materials discovery, as well as the challenges of interpretability, data scarcity, and scalability that persist in the field. We conclude by outlining promising future directions, including the integration of physical constraints into ML architectures, the establishment of standardized benchmarks, and the exploration of hybrid quantum-classical strategies. Overall, this work underscores the transformative potential of AI/ML to deepen our understanding of complex quantum phenomena and to catalyze new avenues of research in condensed matter physics.*
